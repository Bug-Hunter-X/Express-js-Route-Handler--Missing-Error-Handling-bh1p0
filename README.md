# Express.js Route Handler: Missing Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: inadequate error handling. The `bug.js` file shows a route that fails to handle invalid user IDs or the absence of a user, resulting in an unhelpful 500 Internal Server Error. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with proper error handling.

## Bug

The original code attempts to find a user based on the ID passed in the request parameter. However, it lacks error handling for two crucial scenarios:

1. **Invalid User ID:** If the ID is not a valid number, `parseInt(userId)` will return `NaN`, causing the `.find()` method to fail silently. 
2. **Nonexistent User:** If a user with the given ID doesn't exist, the code proceeds to send a generic 500 error, giving no indication of the problem to the client. 

## Solution

The solution involves adding explicit checks:

1. **Validate User ID:** Ensure `userId` is a number before attempting to find the user. 
2. **Handle Nonexistent User:** Send a 404 Not Found response if no user is found.

This approach provides more informative error responses, improving the user experience and simplifying debugging.
